== Introduction

Adhocracy is beta software.  Don't expect it to do anything other
than give you a nasty headache.


== Requirements

* Rails
* A database supported by Rails
* GraphViz
* A gem to interface Ruby with that database
* RedCloth gem
* cgi_multipart_eof_fix gem
* ZenTest gem (optional; for running tests)
* rcov gem (optional; for generating testing coverage reports)

Adhocracy should run on any operating system which Rails supports.
It is currently being developed on Apple Mac OS X 10.4.9, deployed
on Debian GNU/Linux 'etch', and regularly tested on Microsoft Windows
XP SP2.  It has previously been tested on Debian GNU/Linux 'sarge' and
'unstable'.  (Reports of success or failure on other platforms would
be welcome.)

The software is developed and deployed on PostgreSQL (versions ranging
from 7.4.16 to 8.2.4) but thanks to the database abstraction in Rails it
should run on any modern database.  It is frequently tested on SQLite.
(Reports of success or failure with other databases would be welcome.)


== Setup

Get Ruby and RubyGems working, then install all of the required gems.
Generally it is recommended to install Rails as a gem as well.  Likewise
install your database of choice.

Unpack the Adhocracy distribution in your preferred place for running
Rails applications.  There are many ways of running Rails applications
which are well-documented all over the Internet; only bits which are
specific to this project will be covered here.

 tar xvfj adhocracy.tar.bz2

Edit the file config/database.yml inside the Adhocracy directory and
enter appropriate values for your chosen database into the section
labeled 'production', at the bottom of the file.  The default values are
for a PostgreSQL installation on the local host, with database and user
both named 'adhoc', connected via IPv6 loopback.

 cd adhocracy
 vi config/database.yml

At this point you are ready to create your database tables.  This is done
using the Rake task "db:migrate".

 rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

Now we can actually start a web server.  You can actually configure a Real
Web Server (like Apache) for production at this point, but keep in mind that
the first user to register for an account on your new Adhocracy instance
will gain complete administrative control.

Pull up your favorite web browser and point it at http://0.0.0.0:3000/.  You
should be looking at the front page of your new Adhocracy instance.  Create
your account and have fun!
