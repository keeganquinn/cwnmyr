======

cwnmyr is a community wireless network management platform. It is currently
implemented as a Ruby on Rails web application.

Status
------

The code is in a state of complete disarray. It's my belief that some of the
ideas and components may still be useful, however at this point I no longer
feel that the strict, heavily-structured approach which was taken with the
original database design is appropriate.

A new, much lighter database has been designed and can be seen implemented in
the current migrations; however, the application as built on top of this
new database would be little more than a wiki. Any future work related to
this project will likely be focused on tools to process structured text into
things like configuration files and maps, to be used with existing wikis
which already contain relevant data.
